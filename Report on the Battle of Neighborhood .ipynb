In large cities like Tokyo the retail industry is not only driven by the factors like price or designers, but the main factors are culture and traditions. Also Land pricing, venues and brand name. In This project our concentration area will be venue of the designer store. As the store will be open by a designer it has to be in a venue where most of the people are willing to pay for designer clothing.

The Boutiques are either 3rd most or 2nd most common venues which means the foot traffic in Tokyo's major dictricts are interested in looking at the boutique to make new purchases. By looking at the clusters we can figure out that all the major districts's are crowded by clothing store or shoe store and there are less designer boutiques therefore a designer boutique for both men and women can be a profitable business to launch."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
